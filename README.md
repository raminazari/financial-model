 Stock return prediction is of fundamental significance to risk management, investment decision, and trading strategy optimization, for improved accuracy of prediction can lead to reduced losses and increased gains. In the Article, apple's stock price return using the Heston model and a GRU neural network was predicted in this paper, and to further improve the accuracy, the PSO algorithm was applied to optimally combine these two models. The performance showed that the PSO-based hybrid model was better with an MSE of 0.000148, while the Heston model was 0.000428 and the GRU model was 0.000170. The RMSE and MAE of the PSO model were 0.0122 and 0.0082, respectively, showing improvement over the individual models. These findings demonstrate that the use of financial models and deep learning combined with optimization techniques can be utilized to enhance stock return prediction accuracy.
